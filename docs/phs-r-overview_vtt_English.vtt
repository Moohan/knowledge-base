1
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.650
<font color="#ffffff">So, what is R?</font>

2
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.300
<font color="#ffffff">R is a general purpose open- source</font>

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.199
<font color="#ffffff">programming language used  primarily</font>

4
00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:13.516
<font color="#ffffff">in statistical and data science  fields </font>

5
00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:15.916
<font color="#ffffff">Let's look a bit deeper to find  out what that means</font>

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.083
<font color="#ffffff">There were three key terms:  general-purpose, open-source,  and data science</font>

7
00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:22.083
<font color="#ffffff">Let's take general-purpose first</font>

8
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.466
<font color="#ffffff">General-purpose is when a  programming language</font>

9
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.100
<font color="#ffffff">can be used in a wide variety of application domains</font>

10
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.800
<font color="#ffffff">making R useful in many ways</font>

11
00:00:27.816 --> 00:00:29.816
<font color="#ffffff">This could be a calculation of  statistics</font>

12
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.066
<font color="#ffffff">but also graphics and  visualisation production</font>

13
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.416
<font color="#ffffff">application or web development</font>

14
00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:34.600
<font color="#ffffff">and so much more</font>

15
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.683
<font color="#ffffff">This means that R can be used  across the workflow</font>

16
00:00:36.683 --> 00:00:39.850
<font color="#ffffff">without having to manually  intervene or move from one  service to another</font>

17
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.850
<font color="#ffffff">We'll look at a workflow a bit  later</font>

18
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.633
<font color="#ffffff">Comparing to SPSS though</font>

19
00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:45.433
<font color="#ffffff">that's a domain-specific tool</font>

20
00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:47.666
<font color="#ffffff">This means that there's a  specific domain of functionality</font>

21
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.733
<font color="#ffffff">In SPSS, this is relevant to  statistics but there's</font>

22
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.466
<font color="#ffffff">a limitation on connecting to  data sources </font>

23
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.466
<font color="#ffffff">and what's possible with output</font>

24
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.200
<font color="#ffffff">We'll take open-source next</font>

25
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.866
<font color="#ffffff">R is a freely available  programming language</font>

26
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.733
<font color="#ffffff">that has a large community of  developers that </font>

27
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.383
<font color="#ffffff">contribute to its upkeep and new development</font>

28
00:01:01.383 --> 00:01:03.866
<font color="#ffffff">Additionally, through normal use of a functional programming  language</font>

29
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.316
<font color="#ffffff">functions are created  </font>

30
00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:08.700
<font color="#ffffff">this is reusable chunks of code  used to achieve a specific task </font>

31
00:01:08.983 --> 00:01:09.916
<font color="#ffffff">In the case of R </font>

32
00:01:10.416 --> 00:01:13.150
<font color="#ffffff">these functions can be packaged  to provide topic focussed  functions</font>

33
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.150
<font color="#ffffff">This is, again, similar to  Python</font>

34
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.549
<font color="#ffffff">SPSS, however, is an example of  a proprietary technology that is owned </font>

35
00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.983
<font color="#ffffff">and licensed for use by a single company, IBM</font>

36
00:01:20.983 --> 00:01:23.333
<font color="#ffffff">While there's a variety of  methods to achieve a goal in R</font>

37
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.400
<font color="#ffffff">SPSS typically has a much more  restricted set of options</font>

38
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.400
<font color="#ffffff">Finally, there's data science</font>

39
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.833
<font color="#ffffff">Due to the way R was designed </font>

40
00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:33.333
<font color="#ffffff">It's been optimised for  statistical analysis and data  visualisation </font>

41
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:36.616
<font color="#ffffff">This is so much more efficient  and faster than tools like SPSS</font>

42
00:01:36.616 --> 00:01:38.616
<font color="#ffffff">With the ability to use  different processing techniques</font>

43
00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:40.150
<font color="#ffffff">R can work with Big Data-sets</font>

44
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.216
<font color="#ffffff">in a fraction of the time too</font>

45
00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:43.349
<font color="#ffffff">Additionally, as this has grown  a larger community </font>

46
00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:46.033
<font color="#ffffff">more people have been able to  contribute to developing new  packages  </font>

47
00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:48.516
<font color="#ffffff">offering even more specialist  functionality  </font>

48
00:01:48.683 --> 00:01:50.450
<font color="#ffffff">Here are a few of the areas that R can be used</font>

49
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.450
<font color="#ffffff">and are used already in Public  Health Scotland (PHS)</font>

50
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.616
<font color="#ffffff">These can even cross over in the same project</font>

51
00:01:54.616 --> 00:01:56.883
<font color="#ffffff">Like building a web application  or dashboard</font>

52
00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.700
<font color="#ffffff">with data visualisations to  display statistical models</font>

53
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.700
<font color="#ffffff"> and the whole process could use the principles </font>

54
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.099
<font color="#ffffff">of Reproducible Analytical  Pipelines (RAP)</font>

55
00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:06.500
<font color="#ffffff">This is all done through  writing code</font>

56
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.500
<font color="#ffffff">the code is then executed</font>

57
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.566
<font color="#ffffff">and this will likely include  functions</font>

58
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.000
<font color="#ffffff">those reusable chunks which can  be written and refined by topic  experts</font>

59
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.333
<font color="#ffffff">to reduce work and maximise  efficiency</font>

60
00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:17.633
<font color="#ffffff">These functions may be from some well-known packages</font>

61
00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:19.150
<font color="#ffffff">but can also be written by  individuals</font>

62
00:02:19.366 --> 00:02:20.633
<font color="#ffffff">This is what a function would  look like</font>

63
00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:23.533
<font color="#ffffff">taking an input, performing some action, and returning an output</font>

64
00:02:23.983 --> 00:02:25.483
<font color="#ffffff">With these functions they can be written once and</font>

65
00:02:25.483 --> 00:02:27.199
<font color="#ffffff">run again and again</font>

66
00:02:27.216 --> 00:02:29.216
<font color="#ffffff">The use of functions reduces the amount of code</font>

67
00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:31.233
<font color="#ffffff">makes it easier to maintain and  update</font>

68
00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:33.233
<font color="#ffffff">and those with expert knowledge  can produce functions</font>

69
00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:35.233
<font color="#ffffff">that are then shareable across  projects</font>

70
00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:37.666
<font color="#ffffff">to improve efficiency and  accuracy for everyone</font>

71
00:02:37.966 --> 00:02:41.216
<font color="#ffffff">Here are some well-known  packages that you may have heard of</font>

72
00:02:41.216 --> 00:02:43.883
<font color="#ffffff">We also have the phsverse for a  few packages that were developed</font>

73
00:02:43.883 --> 00:02:46.300
<font color="#ffffff">internally for use across our  projects</font>

74
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.033
<font color="#ffffff">Who knows, maybe your project  could use a package of functions too</font>

75
00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:52.683
<font color="#ffffff">Let's look at an example of  workflow, all using R</font>

76
00:02:52.683 --> 00:02:57.366
<font color="#ffffff">We start by sourcing data which  can be from databases, open  data, flat files, web scraping</font>

77
00:02:57.366 --> 00:02:58.816
<font color="#ffffff">and so much more</font>

78
00:02:58.816 --> 00:03:00.533
<font color="#ffffff">Then, we clean and process in  some way</font>

79
00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:04.599
<font color="#ffffff">This can include everything from data validation, calculations,  regression models, </font>

80
00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.750
<font color="#ffffff">and other analysis.</font>

81
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.183
<font color="#ffffff">Then, it's about communicating  that work in some way</font>

82
00:03:08.183 --> 00:03:10.500
<font color="#ffffff">this could be a report,  dashboard, application, </font>

83
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.966
<font color="#ffffff">including visualisations or maps or whatever it takes to reach  your audience</font>

84
00:03:15.016 --> 00:03:18.066
<font color="#ffffff">Up until now, we've looked at  the general features and  benefits of R</font>

85
00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:21.099
<font color="#ffffff">Now, let's see how that's  integrated within Public Health  Scotland (PHS)</font>

86
00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:24.266
<font color="#ffffff">So far, we've been talking about R</font>

87
00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:25.733
<font color="#ffffff">this is the programming  language</font>

88
00:03:25.733 --> 00:03:27.933
<font color="#ffffff">RStudio is another term you've  likely heard of</font>

89
00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:30.400
<font color="#ffffff">That's the software we use to  write and run R code </font>

90
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.400
<font color="#ffffff">RStudio gives us additional  tools and features </font>

91
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.400
<font color="#ffffff">to simplify our coding  experience</font>

92
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.566
<font color="#ffffff">This includes connections to  publishing platforms, like  RStudio Connect</font>

93
00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:40.033
<font color="#ffffff">RStudio runs in a couple of  different places</font>

94
00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:41.816
<font color="#ffffff">One of these is on your computer</font>

95
00:03:41.816 --> 00:03:43.983
<font color="#ffffff">and another that runs on a  central server </font>

96
00:03:43.983 --> 00:03:46.716
<font color="#ffffff">We have a server version  available for staff in Public  Health Scotland</font>

97
00:03:46.716 --> 00:03:48.099
<font color="#ffffff">Let's have a look at how this  works </font>

98
00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:50.566
<font color="#ffffff">Here we have an RStudio server </font>

99
00:03:50.566 --> 00:03:52.716
<font color="#ffffff">this provides centralised access to the RStudio software</font>

100
00:03:52.716 --> 00:03:54.599
<font color="#ffffff">with significantly more power  and memory</font>

101
00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.599
<font color="#ffffff">than what is available on a  user's computer</font>

102
00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.599
<font color="#ffffff">Public Health Scotland also  maintain many databases</font>

103
00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.599
<font color="#ffffff">and other data storage  functionality </font>

104
00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.266
<font color="#ffffff">which is all secure behind a  firewall</font>

105
00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:06.183
<font color="#ffffff">This is a security device to  protect again unwanted access or interference </font>

106
00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:08.866
<font color="#ffffff">As users, we sit at the other  side of that firewall</font>

107
00:04:08.866 --> 00:04:11.433
<font color="#ffffff">and in order to access, we use a VPN</font>

108
00:04:11.433 --> 00:04:14.083
<font color="#ffffff">The VPN provides a secure tunnel for us through the firewall</font>

109
00:04:14.083 --> 00:04:15.449
<font color="#ffffff">connected to the services</font>

110
00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.916
<font color="#ffffff">The connection to the RStudio  server gives us a view of the  interface</font>

111
00:04:17.916 --> 00:04:19.766
<font color="#ffffff">but data is never transmitted</font>

112
00:04:19.766 --> 00:04:23.266
<font color="#ffffff">keeping the load over the VPN  minimal and preventing  unnecessary processing </font>

113
00:04:23.266 --> 00:04:25.433
<font color="#ffffff">This is helped further as the  data sources can also be linked </font>

114
00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:27.000
<font color="#ffffff">directly with the RStudio server</font>

115
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.250
<font color="#ffffff">meaning data is directly  transferrable and we operate  this </font>

116
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.699
<font color="#ffffff">through using the RStudio server interface</font>

117
00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.533
<font color="#ffffff">As users we also have access to  RStudio on our desktop</font>

118
00:04:34.533 --> 00:04:38.633
<font color="#ffffff">However, by using this, any data or call to services on the other side of the firewall</font>

119
00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:40.050
<font color="#ffffff">has to go through the VPN</font>

120
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.266
<font color="#ffffff">So, you're limited to your  devices power and memory but</font>

121
00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:45.833
<font color="#ffffff">also adding strain to the shared resource of the VPN </font>

122
00:04:45.833 --> 00:04:47.833
<font color="#ffffff">So, some best practice...</font>

123
00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:49.283
<font color="#ffffff">Use the RStudio Server </font>

124
00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:52.300
<font color="#ffffff">but if we're using databases,  make efficient use of SQL</font>

125
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.466
<font color="#ffffff">to perform initial filtering and processing of data on the  database system</font>

126
00:04:55.466 --> 00:04:57.833
<font color="#ffffff">such as extracting only  variables and records required</font>

127
00:04:57.833 --> 00:04:59.233
<font color="#ffffff">or joining multiple tables</font>

128
00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:01.183
<font color="#ffffff">This minimises strain on the  RStudio server</font>

129
00:05:02.783 --> 00:05:04.566
<font color="#ffffff">So, now you know all about R</font>

130
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.199
<font color="#ffffff">We have a few channels of  support available </font>

131
00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.850
<font color="#ffffff">The PHS Data Science Knowledge  Base</font>

132
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.050
<font color="#ffffff">is where all our training,  guidance, and best practice  lives</font>

133
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.733
<font color="#ffffff">We have a training pathway  available for R</font>

134
00:05:11.733 --> 00:05:13.850
<font color="#ffffff">so you can pick up a topic  course relevant to you</font>

135
00:05:13.933 --> 00:05:15.716
<font color="#ffffff">An R User Group is available on  Teams for </font>

136
00:05:15.716 --> 00:05:17.716
<font color="#ffffff"> being notified of news and  announcements relating to R </font>

137
00:05:17.716 --> 00:05:19.716
<font color="#ffffff">or asking technical queries</font>

138
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.783
<font color="#ffffff">Finally, the Data Science team  are available</font>

139
00:05:21.783 --> 00:05:24.500
<font color="#ffffff">for wider support concerns and  can signpost where other  resources are</font>

140
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.500
<font color="#ffffff">to best help you or your  projects</font>

141
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.083
<font color="#ffffff">Thanks for watching!</font>
